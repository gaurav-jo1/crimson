# Crimson

Crimson is a powerful multi-file RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to provide intelligent answers based on your own collection of documents. It allows users to organize files into folders and selectively use them as a knowledge base for LLM-powered insights.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-File RAG**: Upload and index multiple PDF documents simultaneously.
- **Folder-Based Organization**: Organize your knowledge base into logical folders like _Cases_, _Books_, _Research_, etc.
- **Selective Knowledge**: Choose specific files or entire folders to provide context for the LLM.
- **Seamless Integration**: Uses Pinecone for efficient vector search and Google GenAI for high-quality responses.
